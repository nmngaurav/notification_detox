**Last Updated:** [Date]

## Introduction

Welcome to Aura (also known as "Notification Detox"). We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle your data when you use our application.

## Our Privacy Commitment

**Privacy and data protection are of utmost importance to us.** We have designed Aura with privacy as a core principle, ensuring that your personal information and notification data remain completely private and secure.

## Data Collection and Storage

### What We Do NOT Collect

**Aura does NOT collect, store, or share any of the following:**

- **No User Information**: We do not collect any personal information about you, including but not limited to:
  - Name, email address, phone number, or any contact information
  - Device identifiers or advertising IDs
  - Location data
  - Usage analytics or behavioral tracking data
  - Any other personally identifiable information

- **No Notification Data**: We do NOT store or share any notification data, including:
  - Notification content (titles, messages, text)
  - Notification metadata
  - App names or package information
  - Notification timestamps or history
  - Any information about your notifications

### What Happens Locally

Aura processes notifications entirely on your device for the sole purpose of providing notification management functionality. Any temporary processing is done locally and is never transmitted outside your device.

## Data Sharing

**We do NOT share your data with anyone.** This includes:

- No third-party services or partners
- No analytics providers
- No advertising networks
- No cloud services
- No external servers
- No data brokers or resellers

## How Aura Works

Aura operates as a notification management service that runs entirely on your device. The app:

1. **Processes notifications locally** - All notification processing happens on your device
2. **No external communication** - The app does not send any data to external servers
3. **No data persistence** - Notification data is not stored or retained
4. **Privacy-first design** - Every aspect of the app is designed to protect your privacy

## Permissions

Aura requires certain permissions to function:

- **Notification Listener Service**: Required to access and manage notifications. This permission is used solely for local processing on your device and is never used to collect or transmit data.

- **Internet Permission**: May be used for app updates or essential functionality, but is never used to transmit personal information or notification data.

- **Package Visibility**: Required to identify installed apps for notification management. This information is used only locally and is never shared.

## Third-Party Services

Aura does not integrate with third-party services that collect or share user data. Any optional services (such as AI classification features) operate entirely on your device or use services that do not collect or store your data.

## Children's Privacy

Aura is not intended for use by children under the age of 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children. If you are a parent or guardian and believe your child has provided us with information, please contact us immediately.

## Data Security

While we do not collect or store your data, we implement security best practices in our app to ensure:

- Secure local processing
- No data leakage
- Protection against unauthorized access
- Regular security updates

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect or store your data, there is no data for you to access, modify, or delete. However, you have the right to:

- Uninstall the app at any time
- Revoke notification permissions through your device settings
- Contact us with any privacy concerns

## Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted in the app and on this page with an updated "Last Updated" date. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically.
